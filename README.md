# Python WebAssembly Demo with Pyodide

This project demonstrates how to run Python code directly in the web browser using WebAssembly via [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/). It provides a simple interactive web page that:

1. Asks the user for their name and greets them using a Python function.
2. Asks the user for a number and calculates its square using another Python function.

## How It Works

- The web page loads the Pyodide runtime (Python compiled to WebAssembly) from a CDN.
- It fetches a Python module (`mymodule.py`) containing the `greet` and `square` functions.
- User input is passed to Python functions, and the results are displayed in the browser—all without any server-side code.

## Files

- `index.html` — The main web page, with UI and JavaScript to interact with Pyodide.
- `mymodule.py` — Python module with the `greet` and `square` functions.

## How to Run

1. **Clone or download this repository to your computer.**
2. **Start a local server in the project directory.**
   You can use Python's built-in HTTP server:

   ```sh
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html) in your browser.

   > **Note:** Opening `index.html` directly with a browser (using a `file://` URL) will not work due to browser security restrictions (CORS). Always use a local server.

## Example Usage

1. Enter your name and click "Greet Me" to see a greeting generated by Python code.
2. Enter a number and click "Calculate Square Root" to see the square (or square root, depending on the code) calculated by Python code.

This project is a minimal example to help you get started with running Python in the browser using WebAssembly and Pyodide.
